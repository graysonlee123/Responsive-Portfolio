                    <p class="about-text">My name is Grayson Gantek, and I am a designer, developer, and illustrator. I grew up in and around Acworth, Georgia (just outside of Atlanta) and am currently working through the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp to earn a certificate in full-stack web development. I've always been a creator for as long as I can remember.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">My story is very similar to other kids from the 90s: Cartoon Network with Toaster Strudel mornings, Gamecube gaming, Heelies, airsoft with best friends in the summers, and most importantly, LEGOs. They taught me how to follow instructions and how to be imaginative, but most importantly, they taught me how to create. These early interests directly influenced the way I carry myself in my personal life and in my professional life.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">Currently I am transferring universities from Kennesaw State University to Georgia Tech. There I plan to study web development and gain a certificate from Georgia Tech.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">I started working at a local print shop in the summer of 2016. My initial role there was lead graphic designer, but during my time there I was taught so much more. I got the opportunity to learn about print design, preparation, and how to work with customers to help figure out what they envisioned their projects to be.</p>
